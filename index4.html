    <p>In 1928, Alexander Fleming, a Scottish bacteriologist, made an accidental yet groundbreaking discovery. <br>
        While researching staphylococcal bacteria, he left his lab in disarray during a vacation. Upon returning,<br>
         he noticed something unusual: a mold, later identified as Penicillium notatum, had contaminated one of his <br>
         petri dishes. Strangely, the bacteria around the mold were no longer growing.

        This moment of serendipity led to the development of penicillin, the world’s <br>
        first true antibiotic. During World War II, penicillin saved countless lives by<br>
         treating infections that were previously fatal. Its discovery marked the beginning of the antibiotic era,<br>
          revolutionizing medicine and offering hope against bacterial diseases.</p>
